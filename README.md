## Documentation

### Create a Instance

```swift
let mempool = Mempool()
```

This command connects the instance to the official mempool space server.

### Connecting to own Instance

You can also connect it to your own instance of mempool.

```swift
let mempool = Mempool(server: "https://yourmempoolinstance.local")
```

### Warning

Please note that each method below is async and may throw errors.
